            The Metropolitan Museum of Art, often referred to simply as "the
            Met," is one of the world's largest and most important art museums.
            It is located on the eastern edge of Central Park in New York City.
          </p>
          <p>
            The museum was founded in 1870 by a group of American citizens who
            wanted to create a museum to rival the great European institutions.
            Today, the Met's collection contains more than two million works of
            art from around the world, spanning 5,000 years of human history.
